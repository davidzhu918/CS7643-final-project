# CS7643-final-project



In this project, we present using various deep-learning approaches to perform image panoptic segmentation on MS-COCO dataset. Specifically, we explored both a bottom-up approach (Panoptic DeepLab) and a top-down approach (Panoptic FPN) for image panoptic segmentation tasks. We experimented with various modifications to the existing state-of-the-art models and discovered promising results.
